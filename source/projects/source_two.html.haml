%p.project__para-1 The Source Two is a lightweight 5” drone with an underslung battery. It pulls great stable footage with a GoPro, even in severely windy conditions. It is capable of running two different battery setups for different purposes.

%p.project__para-1 On a 1500 mAh 4S pack, it is very light and agile, with a very high thrust to weight ratio. With this setup it is excellent for freestyle and just throwing the quad around. It is very very smooth on BetaFlight 4.2 with RPM filtering.

%p.project__para On a 2600 mAh 4S pack, it is excellent for long range cruising and covering long distances with lots of flight time. This ability to do hybrid setups makes this quad very versatile, and is my go to FPV drone to take on trips.
